FlowGen
----------

Flows generator for OpenFlow virtual switch (Open vSwitch) working in OpenStack cloud server.

Initial configuration provided by cloud.json file. It contains information about:
 - OpenFlow controller Floodlight (used to apply new flows on virtual switches and to receive virtual network topology);
 - Cloud servers (hosts, ports, RabbitMQ service queues and routings keys);
 - List of all datapath in all cloud servers with all virtual devices and gateways connected to them.

Application receives events of launching and destroying virtual machines in cloud server.
Then flows (flow table entries) to control all VM's traffic by external firewall running on VM
will be generated and applied on virtual switches of cloud server.
